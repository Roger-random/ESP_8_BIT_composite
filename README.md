# ESP_8_BIT Color Composite Video Out Library

## Purpose

The composite video generation code from
[ESP_8_BIT](https://github.com/rossumur/esp_8_bit)
extracted and packaged into a standalone Arduino library so everyone can
write Arduino sketches that output a color composite video signal.
NTSC and PAL are both supported.

__Huge thanks to Peter Barrett / rossumur for ESP_8_BIT, without which this
library would not have been possible.__

For more behind-the-scenes information on how this library came to be, see
[the development diary](https://newscrewdriver.com/tag/esp_8_bit/)
which has all the details anyone would ever want plus even more that nobody
ever asked for.

## Hardware requirement
* ESP32 (tested on ESP32 DevKitC)
* Composite video connector to ESP32 GPIO25 video signal pin.
* Display device with composite video input port. (Usually an old-school tube TV.)

## Arduino requirement
* [Adafruit GFX Library](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library)
available from Arduino IDE Library Manager.
* [Espressif Arduino Core for ESP32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32),
follow installation directions at that link.

## Installation

This library can now be installed from within the Arduino desktop IDE via the
Library Manager. Listed as "ESP_8_BIT Color Composite Video Library"

It can also be installed from this GitHub repository if desired:
1. Download into a folder named "ESP_8_BIT_composite" under your Arduino IDE's
`libraries` folder.
2. Restart Arduino IDE.

## Classes

1. `ESP_8_BIT_GFX` offers high-level drawing commands via the
[Adafruit GFX API](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library).
Easy to use, but not the highest performance.
2. `ESP_8_BIT_composite` exposes low-level frame buffer for those who prefer
to manipulate bytes directly. Maximum performance, but not very easy to use.

## Examples

1. `GFX_HelloWorld` draws animated rectangles and text, both in changing
colors, using the Adafruit GFX API exposed by `ESP_8_BIT_GFX`.
2. `RGB332_Colors` draws all 256 available colors directly to frame buffer
allocated by `ESP_8_BIT_composite`. Draws once, no updates.
3. `RGB332_PulseB` draws 64 blocks of colors (8x8) representing different
combinations of red (vertical axis) and green (horizontal axis). Uses the
frame buffer of `ESP_8_BIT_composite` directly. Every second, the entire
screen is redrawn with one of four possible values of blue in a pulsing cycle.
4. `GFX_Screen_Fillers` demonstrates several of the common ways to put
graphics on screen. Includes the following APIS: `fillRect`, `fillCircle`,
`drawFastVLine`, and `drawFastHLine`.
5. `AnimatedGIF` demonstrates how to use this video out library with the
[AnimatedGIF decoder library](https://github.com/bitbank2/AnimatedGIF)
by Larry Bank. Art used in this example is

6. `GFX_RotatedText` demonstrates support for Adafruit_GFX::setRotation()
by rendering text in one of four orientations and one of three text sizes.

## Screen Size

* Inherited from ESP_8_BIT, the addressible screen size is __256 pixels wide
and 240 pixels tall__. This means valid X values of 0 to 255 inclusive, and
valid Y values of 0 to 239 inclusive.
  * When displayed on a standard analog TV with 4:3 aspect ratio, these pixels
are not square. So `drawCircle()` will look like a squat wide oval on screen
and not a perfect circle. This is inherent to the system and not considered
a bug.
  * When displayed on a standard analog TV, the visible image will be slightly
cropped due to [overscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overscan). This is
inherent to analog televisions and not considered a bug.
* The developer-friendly `ESP_8_BIT_GFX` class checks for valid coordinates
and will only draw within the valid range. So if X is too large (say, 300)
`drawPixel()` will ignore the command and silently do nothing.
* The raw `ESP_8_BIT_composite` class gives max performance power, but with
great power comes great responsibility. Caller is responsible for making sure
X and Y stay within bounds when manipulating frame buffer bytes via
`getFrameBufferLines()[Y][X]`. Any bugs that use out of range array index
may garble the image, or trigger a memory access violation and cause your ESP32
to reset, or other general memory corruption nastiness __including the
potential for security vulnerabilities.__

## 8-Bit Color

Inherited from ESP_8_BIT is a fixed 8-bit color palette in
[RGB332 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_monochrome_and_RGB_color_formats#8-bit_RGB_(also_known_as_3-3-2_bit_RGB)).
The underlying composite video out code always works with this set of colors.
(See [Examples](https://github.com/Roger-random/ESP_8_BIT_composite#examples).)
* The developer-friendly `ESP_8_BIT_GFX` class constructor can be initialized
in either 8-bit (native) or 16-bit (compatibility) color mode.
  * Adafruit GFX was written for 16-bit color in
[RGB565 format](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/coordinate-system-and-units).
`ESP_8_BIT_GFX` in 16-bit mode is compatible with existing Adafruit GFX
code by automatically downconverting color
while drawing. The resulting colors will be approximate, but they should
closely resemble the original. Using RGB332 color values while in this mode
will result in wrong colors on screen due to interpretation as RGB565 colors.
  * In 8-bit mode, color values given to GFX APIs will be treated as native
8-bit RGB332 values. This is faster because it skips the color conversion
process. Using RGB565 color values while in this mode will result in
wrong colors on screen due to the higher 8 bits being ignored.
* The raw `ESP_8_BIT_composite` class always works in 8-bit RGB332 color.

Sample colors in 8-bit RGB332 format:
|Name|RGB332 (binary)|RGB332 (hexadecimal)|
|----:|:---:|:-----|
|Black  |0b00000000|0x00|
|Blue   |0b00000011|0x03|
|Green  |0b00011100|0x1C|
|Cyan   |0b00011111|0x1F|
|Red    |0b11100000|0xE0|
|Magenta|0b11100011|0xE3|
|Yellow |0b11111100|0xFC|
|White  |0b11111111|0xFF|
