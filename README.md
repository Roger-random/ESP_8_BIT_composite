# ESP_8_BIT_composite_video

## Idea:

Pull the composite video generation code from
[ESP_8_BIT](https://github.com/rossumur/esp_8_bit)
into a standalone Arduino library so others can easily generate Arduino
sketches that output color composite video signal.

Hardware requirement: ESP32

## Status:

Up and running in basic frame buffer mode, no drawing primitives.

## Installation:

1. Download into a folder named "ESP_8_BIT_composite" under your Arduino IDE's
`libraries` folder.
2. Restart Arduino IDE.
